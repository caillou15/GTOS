Write support for XP 8.3 lowercase names?
Lowercase option for fallback and long ISO names?

Have Volume Info return specified lengths?
Set creation time when creating 8.3 name (need to find entry)?
Ignore creation time altogether?

Combine *.tbl files into one file (conserve disk space for boot disks)?
  No, I think it's more flexible having individual files.
CD timezone? (Win98 doesn't, XP does.)
  No.
Drive info cache (keep relevant DPB values in heap)?
  No, it doesn't seem to make a difference (at least with extended DPB).
